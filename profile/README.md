The Simple Configuration Server (SCS) is a server for hosting configuration files and variables that's designed to be simple to deploy and use. The templating system and seperation of secrets allow for hosting configurations that can be fully version controlled (e.g. with git) and using extensions, additional functionality can be added at runtime. The full list of features and how to use them are described on the [documentation website](https://simple-configuration-server.github.io/).

This GitHub organization contains [the source code for SCS](https://github.com/simple-configuration-server/simple-configuration-server), the [SCS Documentation](https://simple-configuration-server.github.io/) and an [example of using GitHub/GitLab](https://github.com/simple-configuration-server/example-configuration) to version control your configurations and deploy them using Workflows or CI/CD. The official Docker image of the SCS can be found in the [GitHub container registry](https://github.com/simple-configuration-server/simple-configuration-server/pkgs/container/simple-configuration-server).
